# Bugs or Suggestions

We strive to make this courseware as accurate and amazing as we can. But let's face it, web sites change each day, Tor hidden services come and go, and the world moves on. Any of these things could mean that our courseware or labs might be inaccurate or broken. We are constantly reviewing the links, sites, and techniques in SEC487 to insure that it is current but sometimes we miss things.

It is amazing to see the breadth of tools and techniques that are used in modern OSINT assessments. If you see something that you think would be a great fit for SEC487, please let us know.

The easiest ways to submit these improvements is by:

1. Using the #coursewaresuggestions channel in the course https://sec487alum.slack.com Slack (See the Day 1 lab to get yourself set up!)
2. Or by sending an email to **<bugs@sec487.info>**
